# Heron

Heron is a media sorting library (similar to dewey) that follows my own 
organizational conventions. It is primarily useful for people who want to 
store media in a fashion that is easily navigable through the folder structure 
and where each file should be identifiable after the fact.

## Installation

    $ gem install heron

## Usage

Assuming your unsorted downloads are all within the Downloads folder:

    cd ~/Downloads
    heron
